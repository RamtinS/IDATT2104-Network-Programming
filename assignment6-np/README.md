# Assignment 6: Websocket 

## Task description

Based on RFC 6455, develop a WebSocket server library using socket programming (do not use any external WebSocket libraries on the server side) with the following functionalities:

1. Perform handshakes with clients.
2. Read short messages from clients.
3. Send short messages to connected clients.

Using this WebSocket server library, create a WebSocket endpoint that can receive messages from a client and then broadcast the received messages to all connected clients.
