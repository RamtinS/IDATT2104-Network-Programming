# Assignment 3: Server/Client with UDP

## Task description

Create a server program that receives two numbers from a
client using the UDP protocol and performs a simple addition
or subtraction based on the client's choice. The client
program should read the numbers from the user and allow 
for repeated arithmetic operations. The server should 
handle the client's requests, return the answer, or send
an appropriate error message back to the client. Responses
and error messages should be printed to the user.
